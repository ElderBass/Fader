## Description

Fader is a React, node.js app geared toward artists but catering towards everyone. It's a social media app at route that allows signed up users to create their own beats with our sequencer. If one is not signed up, you can only view other people's profiles, the mixes they've created, and experiment with the sequencer in our studio, but one can't actually save their creations before signing up.

If one signs up, the sky's the limit. They can follow other artists, leave messages on other artists' profiles, create and save mixes, remix other artists' mixes, and more. 

On launch, the user hits our landing page. They have three options - sign up, browse artist profiles, or enter the studio and start experimenting with the sequencer.

The sequencer itself is a functional React component that utilizes hooks and state to work. Users can add beats and have them render dynamically as the sequencer loops. The user can also adjust the BPMs for the sequencer they are creating by adjusting the slider. 

Overall, the site is geared towards the musically inclined - or anyone with a penchant for hard beats. Experienced or inexperienced, novice or professional, everyone can have fun toying with our sequencer and checking out what other artists have created.
